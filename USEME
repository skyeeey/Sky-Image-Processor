      			 | How to use GuiMain |
      			  --------------------

1. '-file filepath' runs a script that contains commands
2. '-text' runs the program. Input must be done through the console
3. no argument creates the GUI

                            GENERAL RULES

 1. Load must always be used first to load an image into the program
 2. Save can be entered at any time as long as an image is loaded


 - the console at the bottom prints out every action and error messages for when the
   action did not occur

 - the user must first load an image by selecting the file path
	- every button will print an error in the console text area if pressed before load

 - if the user wants to save an image
	- click the save button
	- specify the filename
	- specify the file extension
		- must be '.ppm' '.png' '.jpg' or '.bmp'

 - if the user wants to apply a grayscale
	- click the dropdown menu and select which pixel value grayscale they want

 - if the user wants to apply a blur/sharpen
	- click either of the buttons 'blur' or 'sharpen'

 - if the user wants to apply a flip
	- click either of the buttons 'flip horizontal' or 'flip vertical'

 - if the user wants to brighten/darken an image
	- click either of the buttons and enter a valid positive integer

 - if the user wants to view a red histogram
	- click the 'r' button to view

 - if the user wants to view a green histogram
	- click the 'g' button to view

 - if the user wants to view a blue histogram
	- click the 'blue' button to view

 - if the user wants to view an intensity histogram
	- click the 'rgb' button to view

decrement of 10 and call the new image 'koala-darker'
 > brightness -10 koala koala-darker <

'koala' and call the new image 'koala-vertical'
 > flip vertical koala koala-vertical <
